# Pewlet-Hackard-Analysis
Project for Module 7

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
"Silver Tsunami" is a pretty vivid term. As tsunamis often follow earthquakes, the silver tsunami follows, by 65 years or so, the earthquake of the Baby Boom: the genertation born in the heady years after World War II. Beginning in the 2010s, they reached the age of 65 and began to retire, and as the 2020s dawn, that rate is increasing.

At a huge company like Pewlet-Hackard (PH), this doesn't mean replacing a handful of employees but hundreds, many of which have ascended to important positions within the company after years of dedicated service. There may be a 'Silver Tsunami' in sight, but tsunamis have warning signs and a richter-scale sensitivity to the company's data will help us to predict the coming wave and take steps to get the company to higher ground before the flood.

I have been hired by Bobby, an HR analyst at PH, to incorporate data from six separate employee tables to compile new sets of data that will help the company to peer into the future. This will help PH to anticipate upcoming retirees.

In a second assessment, I will identify experienced employees--who are not yet of retirement age but may be approaching it--to help in a mentorship program to train a new generation of PH employees for leadership and all-around excellence.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* The results indeed show the impending silver tsunami approaching. I searched for employees born between 1952 and 1955 (roughly 67 to 70 years of age). It yielded 133,775  employees. Realizing that many had probably already retired, I searched for those still currently employed and found 72,457 still on the books. That's 72,457 eligible for retirement right now! Silver tsunami indeed
* Searching by position, I found the bulk of these retirement-age employees in senior positions. A third were senior engineers, another third were senior staff, with the rest spread out in other, lesser positions. This showed that PH would have to scramble if it wanted to have qualified in-house canidates to rise up and fill these soon-to-be-open positions.

* Next, I searched for those who were older but not yet of retirement age, focusing on the youngest of this retirement-ready group, those born in 1965, age 57. (The year, 1964, was [the last year of the Baby Boom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baby_boomer.asp#:~:text=%22Baby%20boomer%22%20refers%20to%20a,are%20an%20economically%20influential%20generation.) and the workers from 1965 would be the first born in Generation X. This search yielded a total of 1,940 names.
* I did one additional search that wasn't asked for in the module. I repeated the code I had used for `retiring_titles` to find the current positions in which the potential mentors served. There were only 313 senior engineers (to mentor replacements for 25,915 impending retirees), 490 senior staff (24,926 retirees), and 548 engineers (9,285).
* ![Possible Mentors by Title](https://github.com/JDittes/Pewlet-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/moderator_titles1.png)
* This mentorship calculation shows how difficult it will be to train replacements for so many senior positions over the next few years, which makes an expensive, external recruitment process likely.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
The silver tsunami yards from the Pewlet-Hackard shore. More than 72,000 employees are of retirement age right now (a range of 8 years). Moreover, only 1,940 experienced employees are available to train all these replacements, if we use only the first year after the Baby Boom, 1965.

PH needs to immediately address the upcoming retirements, but it also needs to look beyond employees born in 1965 to act as mentors. I would recommend a look at a broader range of Generation X employees, born from 1965 to 1985, preferably those with 10 years or more experience. This would yield a higher pool of potential mentors and recognize a generational shift that began years ago. Changes need to begin soon.
